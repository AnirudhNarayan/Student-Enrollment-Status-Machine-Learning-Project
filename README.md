# Student Dropout Prediction - Complete Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting student dropout status. The original notebook had several issues that have been completely fixed and enhanced.

## Issues Fixed from Original Notebook

### 1. **Path Issues**
- **Problem**: Used Kaggle-specific paths (`/kaggle/input/`) that don't work locally
- **Fix**: Updated to use local file paths (`train.csv`, `test.csv`)

### 2. **Data Leakage**
- **Problem**: Used `fit_transform()` on test data, causing data leakage
- **Fix**: Proper train/validation split with `fit_transform()` only on training data and `transform()` on validation/test data

### 3. **Missing Evaluation**
- **Problem**: No model performance evaluation or metrics
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive evaluation including accuracy, AUC, classification reports, and confusion matrices

### 4. **Incomplete Ensemble**
- **Problem**: Voting classifier was created but never used for predictions
- **Fix**: Complete ensemble implementation with proper evaluation and predictions

### 5. **No Cross-Validation**
- **Problem**: No model validation or cross-validation
- **Fix**: Added 5-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation

### 6. **Missing Data Analysis**
- **Problem**: No exploratory data analysis
- **Fix**: Comprehensive EDA including target distribution, feature correlations, and visualizations

### 7. **No Feature Engineering**
- **Problem**: Basic preprocessing only
- **Fix**: Proper feature scaling, feature importance analysis, and correlation analysis

### 8. **Incomplete Code Structure**
- **Problem**: Incomplete cells and missing functionality
- **Fix**: Complete, well-structured code with proper documentation
